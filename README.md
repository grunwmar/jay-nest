# jay-nest: Sojka
for fun, relax, clean mind, excersice...

basic syntax
``` python
name = person.get('name') | Jay()
print(name)
```
```
[🐦» 'Name Surname' <class 'str'> ]
Name surname
```
is the same as
```python
name = person.get('name')
print(name)
```
```
Name surname
```
but in first case, the value of `object` is acquired and printed.
